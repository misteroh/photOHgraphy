        <p>Hello! My name is Andrew Oh.</p>
        <p>I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and moved to San Diego, CA to attend the University of California - San Diego where I double majored in Music with an emphasis in Jazz Studies & Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction.</p>
        <p>At UCSD, I worked as a photographer and eventually the photo editor of the UCSD Guardian. I also worked as a photographer for the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technology (Calit2). </p>
        <p>I currently work as a User Interface Developer for  <a href="https://www.ashcompanies.com/" title="American Speciality Health">American Speciality Health</a>.
